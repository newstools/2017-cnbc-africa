Bad weather off the coast of Angola has prevented the berthing of fuel vessels docking at Cabinda and Benguela ports, causing shortages at filling stations and power blackouts, state-energy company Sonangol said.

OPEC-member Angola vies with Nigeria as Africaâ€™s biggest crude oil exporter but has to import its fuel due to a lack of refining capacity.
