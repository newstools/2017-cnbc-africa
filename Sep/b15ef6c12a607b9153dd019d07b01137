Kenya’s Supreme Court on Friday said the electoral board committed “irregularities and illegalities” during last month’s presidential vote, harming the integrity of the election that handed President Uhuru Kenyatta a second five-year term. Four out of six judges said that the vote had been harmed by irregularities. Judges then allowed the two dissenting justices to read their opinions before giving their verdict on whether the irregularities were serious enough to nullify the election results.
